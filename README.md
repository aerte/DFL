All code used for Model training was provided by Bo and adapted by us.

Requirements (any semi-recent version will do):
- torch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- scipy

Futhermore, because Federated Learning is very computationally expensive, we ran CIFAR experiments exclusively on DTU's HPC.
We included a bash script in case the reader has a good enough GPU to run the code locally.
